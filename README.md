Multi
=====

A simple multithreading library for chipKIT and Arduino.

Although there is no support for Arduino yet (lots of platform dependant assembly is required).

The current version does not work yet either. 
It is able to start a new thread, but resuming is currently not possible.
This problem will be debugged and fixed in later commits.
